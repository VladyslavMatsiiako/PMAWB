  <h1> Placement-of-Multiple-Advertisements-on-a-Web-Banner </h1>

<h2> Instances of Experiment 1. Part 2 </h2>
  <p>The instances are given by banner in the following order: 9x9, 10x10, 56x7, 64x8, 28x7, 32x8, 9x45, 10x50, 6x5, 12x10. </p>
  <p> For each instance, the solution value of the optimal placement of advertisements is given. </p>
  <p> For each add, the optimal allocation is given as well. On the right side, for each add, 4 characteristics (ID, width, height, maximum price per pixel) are provided.</p>
  
<h2> Instances of Experiment 2 </h2>
  <p> The same instances are given both in MATLAB and .txt files. </p>
  <p> The instances are of type A<b><li>i</li></b><li>sim</li><b>j</b> where i is the number of banner for which the instances are made and j is the number of simulation. </p>
  <p> The characteristics of instances are given in the following order: id, max price per pixel, width, height, totalsize, shape, proportionality, and total maximum price. </p>
  <p> Here, shape is given as divided by height, proportionality as abs(log(shape)), and total maximum price as area the maximum price per pixel. </p>
