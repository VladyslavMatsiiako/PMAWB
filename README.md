  <h1> Placement-of-Multiple-Advertisements-on-a-Web-Banner </h1>

<h2> Instances of Experiment 1. Part 2 </h2>
  The instances are given by banner in the following order: 9x9, 10x10, 56x7, 64x8, 28x7, 32x8, 9x45, 10x50, 6x5, 12x10. For each instance, the solution value of the optimal placement of advertisements is given. For each add, the optimal allocation is given as well. On the right side, for each add, 4 characteristics (ID, width, height, maximum price per pixel) are given. 
  
<h2> Instances of Experiment 2 </h2>
  The same instances are given both in MATLAB and .txt files. 
  The instances are of type A<b>i</b>sim<b>j</b> where i is the number of banner for which the instances are made and j is the number of simulation.
  The characteristics of instances are given in the following order: id, max price per pixel, width, height, totalsize, shape, proportionality, and total maximum price. 
  Here, shape is given as width/height, proportionality as an absolute value of logarithm of shape, and total maximum price as area * price per pixel.
